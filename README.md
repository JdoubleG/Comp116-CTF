# Comp116-CTF

A report on a Capture the Flag assignment done for a Computer Security class, COMP-116, at [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/) in the Spring 2020 semester.

The report is written by James Garijo-Garde, Connor Wind, Savion Sample, and Jorge Eguiguren.

### Abstract:
In this assignment, our team exploited and surveilled a deliberately vulnerable web server in order to collect specific pieces of information known as flags. These flags were deliberately hidden to guide participants through various cybersecurity techniques and tools. This report shall detail the methods and tools Team 14 used to find each flag, describe challenges Team 14 faced, pose questions to the professor, and provide guidance for securing the exploited web server.
